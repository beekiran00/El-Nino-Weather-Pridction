# El-Nino-Weather-Pridction
A distributed data analysis project which combine high performance computing methods such as PySpark and Machine Learning models.

## The Data.

The data is collected from UCI machine learning repository link: https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/El+Nino

## The Analysis and Prediction

The notebook consists of analysis and prediction using python and high performance computing techniques like PySpark. 
A different approach was taking to perform the prediction, as well as classical clustering techniques to answer all the research questions posed the task.

## Research questions answered:

- How can the data be used to predict weather conditions throughout the world?
- How do the variables relate to each other?
- Which variables have a greater effect on the climate variations?
- Does the amount of movement of the buoy effect the reliability of the data?
